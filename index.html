                        In our seven years #DevTO has worked diligently to organize timely, compelling, and engaging events for our tech-minded and developer community. In 2015, we set out to create one of our biggest and most poignant events yet: International Women’s Day Talks (#IWDTO). A day we celebrate and set a stage for women in tech to gather, speak and cheer with their allies.

                                        We're excited to welcome self taught developer Alicia Carr from Atlanta, GA. Some years back, in a chance moment whist purchasing an iPad, the grandmother of 8 met a teenager who learned how to build an app watching YouTube videos. Enthralled by the idea, she enrolled shortly after in an Objective C course. This eventually led her to build an app focused on a topic near and dear to her heart: a domestic violence app. Purple Evolution, Inc (PEVO) App was established as an effort to empower women experiencing domestic violence with the essential tools required to develop a safe and secure exit plan. Her personal breakthrough and STEM success story has led her to be an invited guest at Apple's WWDC, as well as being included in campaigns by both Apple and GitHub. A staunch supporter and advocate of women in tech, she has spoken at conferences from Austin to Australia, Italy to Ireland, and from Monterrey Mexico to what will be her 1st visit ever to Toronto, where she plans to narrate her personal campaign and goal of empowering women.
